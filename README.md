# Metaverses

Website about metaverses done for Markup Languages course.

The requirement was not to use CSS to align items or give styles to the website, just to change text styles.

The web was developed into my laptop (15.6") so it is not responsive, it has been made for this screen size.

I exposed the website on a video, which is linked above.
